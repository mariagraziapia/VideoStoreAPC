Extracting Frequent Renter Points

(from M. Fowler, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1999)

The next step is to do a similar thing for the frequent renter
points. The rules vary with the tape, although there is less variation
than with charging. It seems reasonable to put the responsability on
the rental. First we need to use Extract Method on the frequent
renter points part of the code.

Again we look at the use of locally scoped variables. Again each is
used and can be passed in as a parameter. The other temp used is
frequentRenterPoints. In this case frequentRenterPoints does have a
value beforehand. The body of the extracted method doesn't read the
value, however, so we don't need to pass it in as a parameter as long
as we use an appending assignment.

I did the extraction, compiled, and tested and then did a move and
compiled and tested again. With refactoring, small steps are the best;
that way less tends to go wrong.
