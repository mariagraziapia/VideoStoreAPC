# Hands-on exercise for the Advanced Programming Concepts School, DESY, Hamburg

## Overview
This exercise is based on the "Video Store Example" described in Chapter 1 of the book: 
M. Fowler, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1999.

A more recent edition of the book has been published; nevertheless, the code documented in 
the first edition is more appropriate to the APC school environment.

The original code presented in the first edition of the book is written in Java; 
it has been ported to C++ for this exercise. 

## Documentation

Associated lectures and documentation are distributed through the APC School web site.
